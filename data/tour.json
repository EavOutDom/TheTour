      "desc": "The ruins of Angkor, </br> </br> located amid forests and Farland, are now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. There are over one thousand temples ranging in scale from nondescript piles of brick rubble scattered through rice fields to the magnificent Angkor Wat which is said to be the world’s largest single religious monument. There are dozens of temple ruins in the Siem Reap area and it depends largely on how much time one has and one’s level of interest to determine how long one should spend to explore them.",
